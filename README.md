This is an implementation of a client application that uses restAPIs of my 
[Microblog - Spring project](https://github.com/teddyedo/MicroBlog-Spring) made with Flutter.

### Quick Guide
To try this application you have to download and launch my Microblog project with your preferred 
Java IDE. Then you have also to download and launch this project with **AndroidStudio**. Also you 
have to download and install Flutter to launch it.

The GUI of this application is similar to the WebApp's one to make the transition between the web 
app and the mobile application as easy as possible.
